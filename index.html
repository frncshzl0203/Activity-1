    <h1>How to cook Dynamite</h1>
    <h2>Recipe by: Mr. Hugh's Kitchen</h2>
    <p>
      I chose Dynamite because this is my favorite food and my auntie cook this
      for me every snack time. Ingredients from Mr. Hugh's Kitchen.

    <h3>Steps in cooking Dynamite</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1:The first component to prepare is the meat filling. This requires
        cooking the ground pork. Start by heating oil in a pan. Saute garlic and
        onion. I like the garlic to brown a bit. This is the reason why I cook
        it first before adding-in the onion. Continue to saute until the onion
        softens. This will provide a mild sweet flavor to the filling.

        Step 2:Add the ground pork. The meat needs to cook thoroughly. Continue
        to saute while stirring until the pork turns medium brown. It takes
        around 5 to 7 minutes when cooked in medium heat. Season with salt and
        ground black pepper.

      <li>
        Step 3:Remove the cooked ground pork from the pan and put it in a bowl
        or plate. Let it cool down for 5 to 8 minutes. Beat a piece of egg and
        pour over the cooked pork and mix well. The egg serves as the binder. It
        helps keep the mixture intact.

        Step 4: Next is to prepare the chili. Slice it lengthwise on one side.
        Remove the seeds and then start to stuff with cheese. The cheese needs
        to be sliced accordingly based on the shape of the pepper. Do not put
        too much cheese. Leave some room for the meat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Step 5:Wrap each stuffed chili in lumpia wrapper. Deep fry until golden
        brown and crispy. You donâ€™t need to worry about the doneness of the
        stuffing because the meat was already pre-cooked. The cheese inside will
        melt as you fry the dynamite lumpia. You should expect a spicy lumpia
        with a crisp skin and tasty and rich filling.
